## Overview

This Proxifier configuration profile is designed to specifically proxy Discord network packets, allowing users in restricted regions like Iran to access Discord without routing all network traffic through a proxy. By using this configuration, users can bypass restrictions imposed by their internet service provider or government without affecting the performance of other applications.

## Advantages

- **Targeted Proxying**: Instead of routing all internet traffic through a proxy, this configuration specifically targets Discord traffic. This ensures that other applications and services operate at their full potential without the overhead of proxying unnecessary data.

- **Easy Profile Swapping**: Proxifier offers a simple profile swapping feature, making it easy for users to switch between different proxy configurations. By utilizing this feature, users can quickly adapt to changing network conditions or switch between different proxy servers as needed.

## Installation

Follow these steps to configure Proxifier for Discord:

1. **Open Proxifier**: Launch Proxifier after installation.

2. **Drag and Drop Configuration Profile**: Simply drag and drop the provided Proxifier configuration profile for Discord onto the Proxifier window.

3. **Configure Proxy Settings**: In the imported profile, ensure that the proxy settings are correctly configured according to your proxy server details. This includes the proxy server address, port, authentication credentials (if required), etc.

4. **Save Changes**: Once you've configured the proxy settings, save the changes.

5. **Enable Profile**: Activate the imported profile by selecting it from the list of available profiles in Proxifier.

6. **Test Connection**: Open Discord and verify that you can connect to the service without any issues. If successful, you should be able to use Discord normally while only Discord traffic is being proxied.
